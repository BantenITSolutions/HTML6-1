    <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I copy pasted this years ago, from a blog I don't write at anymore.
    I first published this nearly three years ago. The site is getting a ton of
    traffic out of nowhere. I haven't updated this aside from minor typos since
    then.  Seriously, it was just some random thing I did for fun one day. It's in
    no way a real spec and should not be taken seriously.

    <p>I've since moved onto starting my own company called <a
    href="http://getpiggybank.com">Piggybank</a> and I wont be updating this
    anytime soon.</p>
